#Bridge to Babylon

Bridge to Babylon is a lightweight object relational mapper. The
main goal of this library is simplicity. It is intended to be
used with POJOs without the need of external XML mapping
definition or any kind of annotation. This approache makes
Bridge to Babylon the best compromize between simplicity (no xml
mapping) and light library footprint: You don't use annotations
so you don't have to deploy Bridge to Babylon along your
entities' jar on remote clients.
